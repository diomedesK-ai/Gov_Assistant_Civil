# Contact Center Enhanced with Web Search & Knowledge Base

## 🎯 **What I've Implemented**

I've enhanced the Contact Center Dashboard to properly integrate **both web search AND knowledge base search** functionality, ensuring the AI uses the OpenAI Responses API effectively for comprehensive information retrieval.

## ✅ **Key Enhancements Made**

### 1. **Enhanced AI Prompt**
Updated the Contact Center prompt with explicit search instructions:

```
CRITICAL SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS:
- ALWAYS search uploaded documents FIRST for any information related to queries
- If documents don't contain sufficient information, use web_search for current information
- For current events, product updates, or time-sensitive information: use web_search
- For company policies, procedures, or internal information: search documents first
- When agents need real-time data or external information: use web_search immediately

RESPONSE STRATEGY:
1. Check knowledge base/documents for company-specific information
2. Use web search for current external information, updates, or verification
3. Combine both sources for comprehensive responses
4. Always indicate your information sources to agents
```

### 2. **Complete Function Call Handling**
Added comprehensive realtime event handling for both search types:

- **Web Search Function Calls**: Detects `web_search` function calls and executes them
- **Document Search Function Calls**: Detects `document_search` function calls and executes them
- **Real-time Results**: Shows search progress and results in both chat and call transcript
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallbacks

### 3. **Knowledge Base Integration**
- **Vector Store Access**: Connected to the same knowledge base (`vs_687b5aa0b19c8191bd628a0111b79bc7`)
- **Document Search**: Full document search functionality with streaming results
- **Combined Search**: Can search both internal docs and external web simultaneously

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting:
- Function call detection logging
- Search API response status logging
- Separate Contact Center event tracking
- Visual search indicators in chat

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **For Voice Calls:**
1. Agent starts voice call using enhanced Contact Center prompt
2. When customer asks about policies → AI searches internal documents first
3. When customer asks about current rates/news → AI searches web immediately
4. Results stream back in real-time during the call
5. Agent receives comprehensive information from both sources

### **For Text Chat:**
1. Agent types question in chat interface
2. AI analyzes query and determines search strategy
3. Searches knowledge base for internal information
4. Searches web for current/external information
5. Combines results and provides comprehensive response

## 🎭 **Contact Center Use Cases**

### **Internal Information (Document Search)**
- Company policies and procedures
- Product specifications and features
- Internal troubleshooting guides
- Pricing and plan details
- Escalation procedures

### **External Information (Web Search)**
- Current market rates and pricing
- Product updates from vendors
- Industry news and regulations
- Competitor information
- Real-time service status

### **Combined Approach**
- "Check our policy on refunds AND current industry standards"
- "Find internal troubleshooting steps AND latest vendor updates"
- "Get our pricing AND current market rates"

## 🚀 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test Document Search:**
- "What's our policy on customer refunds?"
- "Find the escalation procedure for billing disputes"
- "Look up product specifications for [product name]"

### **Test Web Search:**
- "Check current exchange rates for EUR/USD"
- "Search for recent industry regulations"
- "Look up current competitor pricing"

### **Test Combined Search:**
- "Find our internal policy AND current industry standards for data privacy"
- "Get our troubleshooting guide AND latest vendor updates"

## 🔍 **Expected Behavior**

### **When Working Correctly:**
1. ✅ Console shows function call detections
2. ✅ Search messages appear in chat: "🔍 Searching the web for..." / "📄 Searching documents for..."
3. ✅ Results stream back in real-time
4. ✅ AI provides comprehensive answers citing sources
5. ✅ Both internal and external information combined appropriately

### **Debug Indicators:**
- `📨 Contact Center received event: response.function_call_arguments.done`
- `🔧 Contact Center function call detected: web_search`
- `🌐 Contact Center searching web for: [query]`
- `📄 Contact Center searching documents for: [query]`
- `📡 Contact Center web search API response status: 200`

## 🎯 **Result**

The Contact Center now functions as a comprehensive information hub that:
- **Searches internal knowledge base** for company-specific information
- **Searches the web** for current external information
- **Combines both sources** for complete responses
- **Works in both voice and text** interactions
- **Provides real-time results** with proper error handling

Agents can now get complete, up-to-date information from both internal company resources and external sources, making them more effective in customer interactions.

## 🔧 **Technical Notes**

- Uses the same `/api/web-search` and `/api/document-search` endpoints as the main application
- Shares the same vector store for consistency
- Enhanced realtime event handling for function calls
- Proper error handling and fallbacks
- Real-time streaming results for immediate feedback
